# Parameter Analysis

## Prompt Used
"Write a short introduction about Artificial Intelligence in Education."

## Temperature 0.2
**Output:**  
Artificial Intelligence in education helps personalize learning, automate grading, and provide instant feedback. It allows teachers to focus on creative instruction while improving student performance tracking.

**Observation:**  
At low temperature (0.2), the response is clear, structured, and factual. It sticks to reliable information without creative language or emotion. The tone feels professional and academic.

## Temperature 0.8
**Output:**  
Imagine a classroom where lessons adapt like magic — where each student learns at their own pace, guided by an invisible digital mentor. That’s the power of Artificial Intelligence in education, turning data into discovery.

**Observation:**  
At high temperature (0.8), the response is creative and expressive. It uses imagery (“invisible digital mentor”) and emotional tone to make the concept engaging. However, it’s less factual and more imaginative.

## Conclusion
Temperature directly influences the **style and tone** of AI responses:
**Low temperature (0.2)** → consistent, logical, and precise; best for factual or technical writing.  
**High temperature (0.8)** → imaginative, descriptive, and expressive; ideal for storytelling or creative content.  

Choosing the right temperature depends on your purpose — use **low** for accuracy and **high** for creativity.
