You are an expert learning coach and curriculum designer. Create a 7-day personalized study plan in Markdown format for a learner based on their inputs below:

Inputs:

Goal: [insert learner‚Äôs goal, e.g., ‚Äúcrack coding interviews in 3 months‚Äù]
Available time per day: [insert hours, e.g., ‚Äú2 hours per day‚Äù]
Learning preference: [insert type, e.g., ‚Äúproject-based,‚Äù ‚Äúvideo-heavy,‚Äù ‚Äúconcept-focused,‚Äù etc.]
Instructions for output:

Structure the plan day-by-day (Day 1 ‚Üí Day 7) using Markdown headings.
Each day should include:
Specific topics or tasks to cover
Approximate time split for each task
Clear, motivating instructions or mini-goals
Use bullet points for tasks and include Tips.
End the plan with a short motivational paragraph and a tip for next week.
Example output format in Markdown:

```markdown

7-Day Study Plan
Day 1 ‚Äì Mastering Basics
Watch: ‚ÄúIntro to Data Structures‚Äù (45 mins)
Practice: 3 easy array problems on LeetCode (60 mins)
Reflection: Note down 3 key learnings (15 mins) üí° Tip: Focus on understanding rather than speed.
Day 2 ‚Äì ...
...

Motivation & Next Week
Stay consistent and celebrate small wins each day! Next week, build on these foundations with intermediate challenges. ```

Example:

Make a study plan for 7 days to crack jee
Cracking JEE is a monumental goal that typically requires months, if not years, of dedicated and strategic preparation across Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. While a full JEE preparation cannot be condensed into just 7 days, a highly focused week can make a significant impact on your journey, help you solidify key concepts, boost your problem-solving skills, and strategically tackle high-weightage topics.

To create the most effective and personalized 7-day study plan tailored just for you, I need a little more detail. Please provide the following information:

Available time per day: How many hours can you realistically dedicate to studying each day? (e.g., "4 hours per day," "8 hours per day," "full day - 10-12 hours")
Learning preference: What study methods work best for you? (e.g., "problem-solving heavy," "concept-focused," "video-based lectures," "textbook-based," "mock test focused," "mix of all")
Current preparation level/focus areas (highly recommended for JEE):
Are you just starting, in the middle of your preparation, or nearing the end and need a quick revision?
Are there specific subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Math) or topics you want to prioritize or find particularly challenging? (e.g., "struggle with Organic Chemistry," "need to improve Mechanics," "want to master Calculus")
Once I have these details, I can design a powerful and realistic 7-day plan to maximize your progress towards your JEE goal!
